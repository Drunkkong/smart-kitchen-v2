Inventory kitchen supplies, suggest recipes

## Phase 0
External database to store inventory<br>
Fields: weight, count, name, description, expiration<br>
Code for recipe searching.<br>
Includes using inventory to determine possible recipes based on favorite bloggers<br>

## Phase 1
External database to store recipes, favorites, dislikes, name, category, cook time<br>
Code needs to be updated to include filtering/sorting<br>
Sorting will include meal type, e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack; include cuisine, e.g. Italian, French, ...;
includes cook time, e.g. 10-15 minute range, ....<br>
Save recipes as HTML or some external way to view, as blogs do not keep the recipe forever<br>

## Phase 2
Code to include creating shopping list based off recipes selected<br>
Code to include common exchangeable things like lemon juice to vinegar<br>

## Phase 3
### Add in external devices:
Scanner for barcodes to allow more automated inventory control<br>
Scale to weigh items<br>
Scan receipts to allow more automated inventory control<br>
Add in conversions and inventory management, volume or amount column to database<br>
E.g. 2C of milk used to make X recipe, 1 gallon - 2C is Y gallons or Z cups or W oz<br>
Work with vendors/grocery stores to get access to databases of barcodes.<br>
Optional: Potentially add in option for grocery stores to pay to appear on shopping lists<br>

## Phase 4
Mobile app to show live grocery list, no need to print<br>
Database inventory update to include coupons and bargain shopping. Price matching or best deals<br>
Include pictures with the barcode early in the process, that way 1 gallon of milk is the same if itâ€™s from Publix or
Walmart. Also utilize AI/machine learning to learn average usage for items. Help plan shopping trips<br>
